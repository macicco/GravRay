Gravitational Ray Tracing
=========================

To Do
=====

- Use the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm to generate more points in the
  configuration space (see
  eg. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm).
  Since the problem is multidimensional think about implementing the
  Gibbs sampling algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling).

  Example: calculate the density at all NEOs.  Find the largest one.
  Generate a new set of orbital elements following gaussians or Gibbs
  sampling.  Test the density at the new point.  Continue.

  Remember to wait until the 1,000 object generated to draw the new
  sample (burn-in period).
